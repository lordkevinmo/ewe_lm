This repo contains different tasks I've done for several Natural Language Processing tasks concerning the Ewe language.

According to Wikipedia, Ewe is a Nigerâ€“Congo language spoken in Togo and southeastern Ghana by approximately 4.5 million people as a first language and a million or so more as a second language. Ewe is part of a cluster of related languages commonly called Gbe; the other major Gbe language is Fon of Benin. Like many African languages, Ewe is tonal.
